# AWS_IP_Prefix_Finder
This program was created with the intent to pull the current AWS IP-Ranges JSON file and return you a list of all of the IP Prefixes for a specific Region and service based on your input. 


Currently the program only searches for the "EC2_INSTANCE_CONNECT" service, as that was my initial use-case for this program.  I plan to add a feature to allow you to input the service name, to allow easy sorting for IP Prefixes for all services listed in the provided JSON file.
